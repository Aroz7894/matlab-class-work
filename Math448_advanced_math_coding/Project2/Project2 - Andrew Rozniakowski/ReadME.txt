2) For question 2 the code i used to find the root of each of the 3 functions are called
	Project2Newton2_a.m
	Project2Newton2_d.m
	Project2Newton2_e.m
All these functions take inputs for x_0 and y_0 but the code i used to create the graphs used for determining the basins of atraction call my newtons methods and are called
	Project2Part2GraphA.m
	Project2Part2GraphD.m
	Project2Part2GraphE.m
To run these files just make sure all the files, including the newtons code, are in the same folder
The graphs these files create are also in the this folder saved as pictures named:
	Part2GraphA
	Part2GraphD
	Part2GraphE
There is also a program for the 2 mandelbrot sets called:
	Mandelbrot2D
	Mandelbrot3D
however Mandelbrot3D does not work. Neither program takes an input.
3) For question 3 the majority of my work can be found in the file:
	 Project2part3
This includes questions 3a, 3b, 3d, 3g, 3h
Hoewever the program that had to be created in question 3c is called:
	Project2Part3c
